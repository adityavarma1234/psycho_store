It felt like the clouds were moving too fast that night and the moon seemed so damn clear, it felt odd that I could distinctly see the spots on it. But then I realised that I had my specs on, which after wearing makes me feel that i just moved from 360p to 1080p. There was still some work left to do though, the new feature was almost done, but the testing part was still pending. I loaded the code into the device's rom and hoped that it would work when the time would come. This was a kind of pretty primitive device according to the technological standards of today, that I had assembled and programmed myself but it gets my work done pretty good, so I don't see any reason to complain. The idea behind it was pretty simple, I was just exploiting the knee-jerk reaction of a person involved in a gun fight. So I asked myself "What would make an average hired mercenary flinch when he is in a gun fight"? The answer is pretty simple if you think about it, its the sound of a gun shot being fired at him. So I just glued a simple microcontroller, a motion sensor and a small high pitched speaker together, loaded the sound of a gun shot into it and voila I had my own turret except it just makes the sound of a gun being fired instead of actually firing it, but surprisingly it has been really helpful in stalling people around corners. I just stick it at different places and it gives me ample time to move forward before they realise whats happening. So the device was loaded with the code and all set to use. The only thing now left was to collect the ingredients for my burger.
